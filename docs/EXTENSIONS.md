---

### 5. Python Debugger
**Extension ID:** `ms-python.debugpy`

**Description:**
Advanced debugging capabilities for Python applications with breakpoints and step-through debugging.

**Why it's needed:**
- Debug the CLI application with breakpoints
- Step-through debugging capabilities
- Variable inspection and watch expressions
- **Pre-configured:** Debug setup included in `.vscode/settings.json`

### 6. Ruff
**Extension ID:** `astral-sh.ruff`

**Description:**
Extremely fast Python linter and code formatter with comprehensive rule set and VS Code integration.

**Why it's needed:**
- Project configured to use Ruff for linting and formatting
- Fast, comprehensive code analysis (10-100x faster than alternatives)
- Automatic code formatting and import sorting
- Real-time error detection and fixing
- **Configured:** Set as default formatter with format-on-save enabled

## Installation Instructions

1. Open VS Code Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
2. Search for each extension by name or ID
3. Click "Install" for each extension

**Alternative:** Use Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) â†’ "Extensions: Install Extensions"

## Development Workflow

With these extensions installed:
- **Code Development**: Python extension for IntelliSense and debugging
- **Code Quality**: Ruff for real-time linting and formatting
- **Documentation**: Markdown All in One for editing docs
- **Build Management**: Makefile Tools for development commands
- **Configuration**: Even Better TOML for project settings

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Ruff not working**: Check Python interpreter is set correctly
- **Makefile Tools**: Ensure Makefile is in workspace root
- **Python debugging**: Verify virtual environment and interpreter path
- **TOML errors**: Check syntax in `pyproject.toml`
